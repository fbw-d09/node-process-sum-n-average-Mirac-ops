# Sum N' Average
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Create a program that takes in an operation to perform ("sum" or "avg"), and a set of numbers as arguments. The program should print out the result of the calculation to the terminal.

- **work in `solution.js`**

## Constraints:

- The first argument can only either be the string `"sum"` or the string `"avg"`. In case it is not, the program should exit and print a message to the user (see examples below).

- Any following arguments must be numbers. In case one of the is not a number, the program should exit and print a message to the user (see examples below).

## Examples:

### 1. Calculating the sum

```bash
$ node solution.js sum 1 2 3 4
> 10
```

### 2. Calculating the average

```bash
$ node solution.js avg 1 2 3 4
> 2.5
```

### 3. Wrong operation name

```bash
$ node solution.js oops 1 2 3 4
> 'I cannot calculate that, please type either "sum" (to calculate the sum) or "avg" (To calculate the Average)'
```

### 4. Wrong type

```bash
$ node solution.js sum 1 hello 3 4
> "Sorry, the argument 'hello' is not a number, please try again"
```

## Bonus:

Add support for an additional operation, `"med"`, which calculates the [**_Median_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) number in the set. To calculate the median you will have to follow the steps below:

1. Sort the set of numbers
2. Get the index of the middle number by dividing the last index of the set by two: `<last index> / 2`
3. If the resulting index is a whole number (e.g. 7) then the median of the set is the value in that index.
4. Otherwise (if the number is a fraction, e.g. 7.5) then the median is calculated by adding the two values in the indexes around it (for 7.5 it would be 7, and 8) and dividing them by two.

**_Example (a)_**: For the set 4 ,7, 8, 11, 24 the median index would be 2 (last index: 4, 4 / 2 = 2) and the median value is 8 (the number at position 2).

**_Example (b)_**: For the set 1, 12, 15, 21 the median index would be 1.5 (last index: 3, 3 / 2 = 1.5) and the median value would be 13.5 (the number at position 1: **12** + the number at position 2: **15** = **27**, 27 / 2 = 13.5).

### Examples

#### Odd amount of numbers

```bash
$ node solution.js med 1 2 5 6 12
> 5
```

#### Even amount of numbers

```bash
$ node solution.js med 1 2 3 4 5 6
> 3.5
```

#### Unsorted set

```bash
$ node solution.js med 1 2 12 13 5 6
> 5.5
```
